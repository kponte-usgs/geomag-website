  Extremely large earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, magnetic storms, and other
  hazardous geophysical events are rare. And yet their occurrence can be
  devastating for humankind. Since direct historical records of extreme
  geophysical events are few, the interpretation of their statistics must be
  conducted with caution. Estimates of occurrence rates are useful, but the
  "error-bar" measures of uncertainty are also needed.
