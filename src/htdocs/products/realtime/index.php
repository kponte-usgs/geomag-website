    Blended data is preliminary data that contains all of the same
    information as the <a href="/products/">Real-Time Data Display</a> with
    the addition of Satellite data used to fill in any gaps in the
    transmitted data.

<h3>View Preliminary Data</h3>
<p>
  A graphical display of preliminary data (updated every 12 minutes) for
  all observatories is available. Each observatory is on a single plot.
  These plots have each of the data streams for each observatory on a
  single plot for that observatory.

<h3>Obtaining Recent Preliminary Data</h3>
<p>
  The USGS Geomagnetism Program operates a downlink center in Golden, Colorado
  for the reception of geomagnetic observatory data via satellite and
  electronic file exchange. Golden is a Geomagnetic Information Node (GIN)
  which, as a member of Intermagnet, is one of several GINs located around the
  world. Intermagnet data, which include those from USGS observatories, are
  available through the <a href="http://www.intermagnet.org">Intermagnet
  website</a> on their Intermagnet Data Download page. Visit our
  <a href="/products/downloads.php">Download</a> page for
  more ways to get USGS data.
